Hello! and welcome To Hours To Max.
Hours To Max is a goal calculator for the game Old School Runescape.
It takes in a players name, a players goal, and the methods used to reach that goal, to calculate the time and cost to reach that goal.

I have created this project as a method to learn Node JS, and Authentication.

The software is a webpage, designed and developed in Node JS/Express.
The live version of this website is hosted on DigitalOcean/Cloudflare/MongodbCloud and can be viewed at hourstomax.com

Running the software:
The software requires installations of NPM (Node Package Manager), and Nodemon to run.
The back end is a MongoDB.

To start the server, run "npm i" to install the required dependencies, then
-npm run startd (To begin in development mode)
-npm run startpu (To bein in production mode)

The dependencies are listed with a brief description in the installs.txt for convenience.
Supporting articles and notes are being lodged in learning.txt.

The current project dev goal, is to convert the V1 Javascript prototype into something
class/Object based, that will be more scalable, expandable, and maintainable.

I am looking to become employed as a software developer in 2025.
Please reach out via email if you would like to contribute, grab a coffee, or are hiring a software developer.
